# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-PROJECT-PRECISION-(0.96%)
Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

Project Description: This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. The model was trained on a dataset of patient records, and it achieved a precision of 0.96%. This means that the model correctly identified 96% of the patients who had heart disease.

Project Goals: The goals of this project were to:
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease
Improve the accuracy of heart disease prediction
Provide a tool that can be used by doctors to diagnose heart disease

Project Methods: The following methods were used to develop the machine learning model:

Data collection: A dataset of patient records was collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 14 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar.
Data preprocessing: The data was preprocessed to remove any missing values and to normalize the features.

Model training: The machine learning model was trained using a variety of algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

Model evaluation: The model was evaluated using a holdout dataset. The holdout dataset was not used to train the model, and it was used to assess the model's accuracy.

Project Results: The machine learning model achieved a precision of 0.95%. This means that the model correctly identified 95% of the patients who had heart disease.

Project Conclusion: The results of this project show that machine learning can be used to accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease. This tool can be used by doctors to diagnose heart disease and to improve the quality of care for patients with heart disease.
